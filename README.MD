# Basic IRC Client & Server
A basic IRC Client & Server written in Odin as a toy & example project.   
The Client is limited to 1 channel & server connection at a time.  
Whilst the Server in set up to handle multiple channels, has only been tested with one.  
Both will handle & send UTF-8, however the Server's case mapping is always ASCII.
